    "This challenge is about revealing the relevance of deep learning in the field of a certain type of cyber attack: the Side-Channel Attack (SCA). SCA harvests Side-Channel Analysis information in order to breach a protected system. This information consists in physical measurements associated with the hardware on which the cryptographic algorithms are implemented. Here, we consider the use of electromagnetic measurements of a smart card as a side-channel to attack an AES implementation. The project was inspired by the work of an ANSSI and CEA team https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD formalized in a research article https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/053.pdf \n",

    "This challenge focuses on the ability of deep learning to help in the cracking of encryption in small hardware that would typically be embedded in IoT devices. IoT devices are central among the cybersecurity concerns, since the upcoming IoT revolution translates into a massive introduction of connected devices among networks, which is directly associated with a wealth of personal and sensitive data. Connected devices have a history of being targeted by cyber attacks since many of them aren't well protected when one consider the interest of the data if gives access to. According to the EU 2017 cybersecurity facts sheet, there will be tens of billions of connected digital devices in the EU alone by 2020.\n",
